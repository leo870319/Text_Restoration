| _Erkenntniswert_ | cognitive value | 認知價值 | **Rationale:** Lit. "cognition-value." Refers to the intrinsic value of science as a system of cognitions (_Erkenntnissen_), distinct from its practical application. |
| _Gebrauchswert_ | use-value | 使用價值 | **Rationale:** A direct translation. Refers to the value derived from the purposeful *application* (_Anwendung_) of scientific knowledge. The author argues modern society over-emphasizes this aspect. |
| _Folgen_ | consequences | 後果 | **Rationale:** The author's third category. Defined as *all* effects beyond cognition and use-value, including unintended side-effects (_Nebenfolgen_) and the effects of non-application. |
| _Funktionen_ | functions | 功能 | **Rationale:** A subset of _Folgen_. Defined by the author as *regular* consequences (manifest or latent) that make a *steady contribution* to the "functioning" of a society. |
| _regulative Funktionen_ | regulative functions | 調節功能 | **Rationale:** The article's central concept. This does *not* mean the intended, manifest regulation (e.g., regulating a river). It refers to the *latent, unintended* (_absichtslos_) contribution science makes to *social regulation* by coordinating interests. |
| _absichtslos_ | unintended / intention-less | 無意的 / 非刻意的 | **Rationale:** Lit. "intent-less." This is the key modifier for latent functions. It implies a *structural* lack of intent, a by-product of science's mere existence, not a conscious goal or a random accident. |
| _Selbstvervollkommnung_ | self-perfection | 自我完善 | **Rationale:** Lit. "self-completion." Used to describe the pre-modern, classical view of science (esp. philosophy) as a path to personal, moral, or spiritual fulfillment, not practical utility. |
| _Lebens- und Handlungssituation_ | life and action situation | 生活與行動情境 | **Rationale:** A sociological term for the concrete, practical circumstances in which people live and must make decisions. Science only becomes relevant to the public when it affects this. |
| _Bewußtseinslage_ | state of consciousness | 意識狀態 | **Rationale:** Lit. "consciousness-situation/layer." Refers to the conceptual and mental landscape of an era or group, which science can alter even without direct application. |
| _verwissenschaftliche Gesellschaft_ | scientized society | 科學化的社會 | **Rationale:** Lit. "scientized" or "academized" society. A modern society *structurally dependent* on the organized application of science for its daily survival. |
| _Willens- und Zielbildung_ | will and goal formation | 意志與目標的形成 | **Rationale:** The political and social process by which a society or group decides on its collective goals. The author argues science's latent function is a *precondition* for this process. |
| _segmentäre Gesellschaften_ | segmentary societies | 片斷社會 | **Rationale:** An anthropological term (cf. Durkheim, Evans-Pritchard) for simple societies structured by repeating, equivalent segments (like kinship groups), which provide coordination. |
| _Herrschaft_ | rule / domination | 支配 | **Rationale:** A central Weberian concept. The author critiques _Herrschaft_ as an insufficient mechanism, by itself, for coordinating a complex pluralistic society. |
| _Setzungen_ | positings / stipulations | [人為]設定 | **Rationale:** From the verb _setzen_ (to set, to posit). Refers to consciously made rules, laws, and decisions that replace unconscious tradition as the basis of social order. |
| _verselbständigen sich_ | become autonomous / (to) autonomize | 自主化 | **Rationale:** From _selbständig_ (independent). The verb describes a process of *becoming* independent or autonomous *from* a larger context. Here, group interests detach from a sense of the societal whole. |
| _kommensurabel_ | commensurable | 可通約的 | **Rationale:** A philosophical/mathematical term. The core coordination problem is that conflicting group demands are *incommensurable* (lacking a common measure or standard of comparison). |
| _Leerformeln_ | empty formulas | 空洞公式 | **Rationale:** Lit. "empty formulas." Refers to high-level values (e.g., "justice," "freedom") that are too abstract to logically deduce concrete actions from, making them insufficient for coordination. (Ref. Footnote 11). |
| _Gesellschaftsbilder_ | societal images | 社會圖像 | **Rationale:** Lit. "society-pictures." The term for the (often ideological) holistic conceptions of society that groups create to legitimize their specific, partial demands. |
| _Schiedsfunktion_ | umpire function / arbitration function | 仲裁功能 | **Rationale:** From _Schiedsrichter_ (umpire/arbitrator). Science's key latent role. It does not *judge* the "fairness" (a value) but acts as a neutral umpire that clarifies the *factual* basis, making demands comparable. |
| _Tatsachenzusammenhänge_ | factual interrelationships / factual contexts | 事實脈絡 / 事實關聯 | **Rationale:** Lit. "fact-interconnections." This is the key domain of science. Not just isolated facts (_Tatsachen_), but the *system* or *context* (_Zusammenhang_) connecting them. Science projects value-claims onto this *system* of facts. |
| _Sachautorität_ | factual authority | 事實權威 | **Rationale:** *Sache* (matter, fact) + *Autorität*. This is the *basis* of science's _Schiedsfunktion_. It is an authority derived *specifically* from its competence with facts, not from moral or political standing. |
| _Sachlichkeit_ | factuality / objectivity / impartiality | 事實性 / 客觀性 | **Rationale:** The *ethos* required for _Sachautorität_. It is the quality of "sticking to the facts" (_Sache_). It is the *practice* of separating fact from value. |
| _Auftragsforschung_ | contract research / commissioned research | 委託研究 | **Rationale:** Research commissioned and paid for by an external body (government or private industry), which the author cites as a potential threat to scientific freedom. |
| _Bewältigungsprozeß_ | coping process | 應對過程 | **Rationale:** Lit. "mastering-process." Refers to the psychological, spiritual, and intellectual work individuals must do to "cope with" or "master" their existence and find meaning. |
| _Geisteswissenschaften_ | humanities | 精神科學 | **Rationale:** Lit. "sciences of the spirit/mind" (_Geist_). While "humanities" (人文科學) is common, 精神科學 is the more etymologically faithful translation, fitting the context of "coping processes" (_Bewältigungsprozeß_) and "meaning-making." |---
