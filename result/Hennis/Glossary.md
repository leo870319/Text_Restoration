| _Geisteshaltung_ | disposition of mind / mental attitude | 精神姿態 / 心態 | **Rationale:** Lit. "spirit/mind-posture." The author uses this to define Rationalism not as a specific theory, but as a deep-seated *posture* or *disposition* that shapes how one perceives all reality (e.g., as a set of "problems" to be "solved"). |
| _Kümmerform_ (der Vernunft) | stunted form (of reason) | (理性的)  stunted (stunted) form | **Rationale:** Lit. "grief-form" or "paltry-form." A powerful, critical term implying a form that is underdeveloped, withered, or pathetic. The author's thesis is that modern Rationalism is not the fullness of Reason, but a *stunted* version of it. |
| _Existenzsicherung_ | securing of existence / existence-security | 生存保障 | **Rationale:** Lit. "existence-securing." A key "given" (_Vorgabe_) for the conference. The author argues that in the modern rationalized *Sozialsystem*, this is no longer primarily achieved *by* one's own work. |
| _Lebenswert_ | value of life / life-value | 生命價值 | **Rationale:** Lit. "life-value" or "worthwhileness of life." The second conference "given." The author argues this is now sought *outside* of work, in leisure and consumption, because work itself has been devalued by rationalization. |
| _Vorgaben_ | givens / pre-set goals | 既定目標 / 預設 | **Rationale:** Lit. "given-before." A key term. In its first use, it refers to the conference's "given" themes (_Existenzsicherung_, _Lebenswert_). It later becomes synonymous with the rationalist's *Zielvorgaben*—the *pre-set goals* that define and precede all action. |
| _Zielvorgaben_ | pre-set goals / goal-specifications | 既定目標 | **Rationale:** A compound of _Ziel_ (goal) and _Vorgaben_ (givens/specifications). This is Characteristic 3 of Rationalism: the belief that all rational action is merely the "implementation" of a *pre-set, pre-defined goal*, as opposed to 'taking care of the necessary' as it arises. |
| _das Besorgen des Nötigen_ | taking care of the necessary | 料理必要之事 | **Rationale:** A crucial counter-concept to _Zielvorgaben_. This is the author's term for the *older* understanding of work and politics: a practical, *circum*spective activity of "taking care" (_Besorgen_, cf. *cura*) of what is "necessary" (_Nötigen_) in a given situation, without a grand, pre-set plan. |
| _historisch Gewachsenen_ | the historically grown | 歷史中長成者 | **Rationale:** Lit. "the historically grown." This is the primary antagonist for the rationalist mind, which (per Descartes) prefers the "new" and "planned from one cast" (_aus einem Wurf_) and dismisses the "grown" as chaotic and "accidental." |
| _sich ausweisen_ | to justify itself / to provide credentials | 自我證明 / (無法)出示其憑據 | **Rationale:** Lit. "to show-out" (as in, to show one's ID). The author notes that for Descartes, the "historically grown" *kann sich nicht ausweisen*—it cannot "provide credentials" or "justify itself" before the court of Reason, which demands a plan. |
| _Sachlich_ / _Sachlichkeit_ | factual / impersonal / objective | 事實性的 / 客觀性 | **Rationale:** From _Sache_ (matter, fact, thing). This is Characteristic 2. Rationalism prefers the "factual" or "impersonal" system over personal bonds. This is the basis of *rationale Herrschaft* (rational rule) in Weber, but the author highlights its negative consequence: the loss of *Treue* (loyalty). |
| _praktische Vernunft_ | practical reason | 實踐理性 | **Rationale:** The key faculty that the author claims Rationalism is destroying. This is not the *Problemlösungskapazität* of the rationalist, but the older, Aristotelian/Kantian concept of reason applied to *action* and *conduct*, rooted in experience and circumspection. |
| _umsichtig_ / _Umsicht_ | circumspect / circumspection | 審慎的 / 審慎 | **Rationale:** The author's final, positive term, used to define *praktische Vernunft*. It contrasts with the one-directional, goal-fixated *pro*spective thinking of the rationalist. *Umsichtig* means "looking around" (um-sicht), being prudent, cautious, and aware of the whole context. |---
