| _Auslese_ | A core concept drawn from evolutionary biology but applied socially. It refers to the process by which the industrial apparatus "selects" specific human types that fit its requirements, rejecting the unfit. Weber distinguishes this from biological natural selection, focusing on social and economic mechanisms. | Selection | 揀選 |
| _Anpassung_ | The reciprocal process where the workforce modifies its physical and psychophysical habits to meet the demands of the industrial machinery and discipline. | Adaptation | 調適 |
| _Berufsschicksal_ | Not merely a "career," but the trajectory of life as determined by the external, coercive forces of the economic order. _Schicksal_ implies an inescapable power inherent in the modern system. | Occupational Destiny / Fate | 職業命運 |
| _Geschlossene Großindustrie_ | The specific object of the survey: highly capitalized, mechanized, and bureaucratically organized industrial units that form a "closed" system distinct from handicraft or small business. | Closed Large-Scale Industry | 封閉式大工業 |
| _Arbeitseignung_ | The specific fit between a worker's psychophysical qualities and the technical demands of a machine or task. | Work Suitability / Aptitude | 工作適性 |
| _Gelerntheit_ | A noun formed from the participle _gelernt_. Weber uses it to quantify the degree and type of training (apprenticeship vs. quick instruction) required for a job. | Skilled-ness / Learned-ness | 學成度 |
| _Anlage_ | The innate, biological potential or disposition of an individual, often contrasted with _Milieu_ (environment) and _Übung_ (practice). Used to investigate hereditary differences in work suitability. | Disposition / Heritage | 稟賦 / 素質 |
| _Eingestelltheit_ | A psychophysical term referring to the state of readiness or mental/physical adjustment for a specific task or stimulus. Used by Weber to explain resistance to change or adaptation to monotony. | Set / Attitude / Adjustment | 定勢 / 心理預備 |
| _Lebensführung_ | A central Weberian concept referring to the methodical, conscious management of one's daily existence. In this text, it is examined under the pressure of industrial discipline. | Conduct of Life | 生活經營 |
| _Lebensstil_ | Distinct from _Lebensführung_, this often refers to the visible, external mode of living, consumption habits, and cultural expression outside of the workplace. | Life Style | 生活風格 |
| _Nutzeffekte_ | The measured or calculated benefits derived from the work, especially in the calculation of wage costs and worker performance (utility/efficiency). | Utility Effects / Useful Effects | 效益 |
| _Stammrollen_ | Literally "stem rolls" or "personnel rolls." Weber applies this military term to the detailed personnel records of factory workers (including age, provenance, and sometimes family status) to analyze workforce composition. | Personnel Rolls / Worker Rosters | 員工名冊 |
| _Arbeitsanweisung_ | A direct command or set of instructions. Weber explicitly states his document is an _Anregung_ (Suggestion) and deliberately *not* an _Arbeitsanweisung_ to encourage critical thought. | Work Instruction | 作業指示 |
| _Anregung_ | A suggestion or stimulus for thought/action. Weber's actual posture in presenting the methodology. | Suggestion / Stimulus | 提議 / 啟發 |
| _Morphologisch_ | Literally "morphological," referring to the form or structure. Weber excludes merely morphological problems like organizational charts, focusing instead on the social/human *consequences* of those forms. | Morphological | 形態學的 |
| _Organische Zusammensetzung des Kapitals_ | The "organic composition of capital," a concept borrowed from Marx, referring to the ratio of constant capital (means of production) to variable capital (labor) as determined by technical conditions. Used here to analyze technological change and its impact on labor demand. | Organic Composition of Capital | 資本的有機構成 |
| _Vererbung_ | The biological transmission of traits from parent to offspring. Examined here in the context of innate psychophysical differences in work suitability. | Heredity | 遺傳 |
| _Volkscharakter_ | A conventional, often vague, concept of national or ethnic character used to explain qualities of the workforce. Weber treats this term critically, noting it confuses biological inheritance and cultural tradition. | National Character | 民族性格 |
| _Milieu_ | Environment or social setting. Contrasted with _Anlage_ (Disposition) to analyze the source of worker qualities. | Milieu / Environment | 環境 |
| _Übung_ | Practice or repeated exercise. | Practice | 練習 / 操練 |

| _Geistesgegenwart_ | Presence of mind; a specific quality required for tasks like multi-loom weaving, implying continuous, dispersed alertness rather than intensive intellectual thought. | Presence of Mind | 應機 / 臨場反應 |
| _Wertbeziehung_ | Value-relevance; a methodological concept where an object of study is selected because it relates to cultural values. Weber notes monotonous work often lacks this connection. | Value-Relevance | 價值關聯 |

| _Akkordsatz_ | The rate of pay for a single piece of work completed (piece-rate). | Piece Rate | 計件工資率 |

| _Gewerkschaftsstatistische Erhebung_ | The second main type of survey: a broad, quantitative investigation based on data collected through trade union organizations. | Trade-Union Statistical Survey | 工會統計調查 |
