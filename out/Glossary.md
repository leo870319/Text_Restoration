| _kosmisk panikfølelse_ | cosmic panic-feeling | 宇宙性恐慌感 | **Rationale:** Lit. "cosmic-panic-feeling." This is Zapffe's central term for the existential horror that defines the human condition, arising when consciousness awakens to its own isolation in the cosmos. |
| _livs-enheten_ | life-unity | 生命的統一體 | **Rationale:** Lit. "life-the-unity." Refers to the pre-conscious, harmonious state of being part of nature's "blind law," which man "breaks" (brudd) with his self-awareness. |
| _hypertrofi_ | hypertrophy | ［病態］肥大 | **Rationale:** A biological term used by Zapffe to describe consciousness itself. It is not a gift, but a "hypertrophy of a catastrophic nature," an over-development of one ability that makes the entire organism unfit. |
| _verdensangsten_ | the world-anxiety | 世界焦慮 | **Rationale:** A compound of "Verden" (World) + "Angst." A key result of consciousness, distinct from animal fear. It is a generalized anxiety about the *nature of the world itself*. |
| _livsfortvilelsen_ | life-despair | 生命絕望 | **Rationale:** A compound of "Liv" (Life) + "Fortvilelse" (Despair). The despair that comes from understanding the *processes* of life (e.g., the cycle of death, the "senseless mess" of organic matter). |
| _livs-udygtig_ | non-viable / unfit-for-life | 無法存活的 / 不適“生”的 | **Rationale:** Lit. "life-un-able" or "life-in-capable." A key biological concept. Consciousness has made the human species *livs-udygtig* by its very nature, like the giant deer (*cervus giganticus*) who supposedly died out from its oversized antlers. |
| _fortrængning_ | repression | 壓抑 | **Rationale:** The central defense mechanism. From "trenge" (to press/push). While related to the Freudian term, Zapffe uses it as the *conscious or unconscious* "repression of one's damaging surplus of consciousness" (*skadelige bevissthetsoverskudd*), which is necessary for "normal" life. |
| _isolation_ | isolation | 隔離 | **Rationale:** The first of the four mechanisms. Defined by the author as a "fully arbitrary dismissal from consciousness of disturbing and destructive thoughts and feelings." |
| _forankring_ | anchoring | 錨定 / 寄託 | **Rationale:** The second and most detailed mechanism. Lit. "anchoring." The process of "fixing points" (*fastlægning av punkter*) or "building walls" (*opbygning av mure*) against the "liquid chaos" of consciousness. These "anchors" (parents, home, God, nation, one's job) are cultural or personal fictions we cling to for stability. |
| _livsløgn_ | life-lie | 生命的謊言 | **Rationale:** A direct reference to Ibsen's "The Wild Duck" (*Vildanden*). Zapffe uses it as a prime example of a *forankring* (anchoring) — a necessary, illusory value that makes life bearable. |
| _distraktion_ | distraction | 分心 / 消遣 | **Rationale:** The third mechanism. The tactic of "chaining" (*fægsle*) one's attention with a "ceaseless new stream of impressions from without" to prevent the mind from turning inward. |
| _sublimation_ | sublimation | 昇華 | **Rationale:** The fourth and rarest mechanism. A "transformation" (*forvandling*) rather than repression, where the very "pain of life" (*livssmerten*) is converted into "experiential value" (*oplevelsesværdi*) through aesthetic or artistic framing. |
| _sjælelig arbeidsløshet_ | spiritual unemployment / psychic unemployment | 靈性失業 / 精神失業 | **Rationale:** Lit. "soul-ly" or "of-the-soul" (sjælelig) + "unemployment" (arbeidsløshet). The state created by civilization and technology. By making survival easier, "progress" renders a large part of our cognitive ability "superfluous" (*overflødig*), leaving this idle consciousness to revert to its natural state of panic. |
| _undergangens idé_ | the idea of doom / the idea of destruction | 毀滅的理念 | **Rationale:** Lit. "the-destruction's-idea." The ultimate truth of the human biological condition, which the Last Messiah will finally articulate: that humanity's destiny is, and ought to be, its own *undergang* (doom/downfall/extinction). |---
