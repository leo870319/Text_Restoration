| German Term | English Translation | Chinese Translation | Definition/Context |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _Erkenntniswert_ | cognitive value | 認知價值 | **Rationale:** Lit. "cognition-value" or "knowledge-value." Refers to the intrinsic value of science as a system of cognitions (_Erkenntnissen_), distinct from its practical application. |
| _Gebrauchswert_ | use-value | 使用價值 | **Rationale:** A direct translation, likely referencing the Marxian concept but used here in a general sense: the value derived from the purposeful *application* (_Anwendung_) of scientific knowledge. |
| _Folgen_ | consequences | 後果 | **Rationale:** The author's third category. He specifically defines this as *all* effects beyond cognition and use-value, which includes both the unintended effects of non-application (e.g., changing consciousness) and the unintended side-effects (_Nebenfolgen_) of application. |
| _Funktionen_ | functions | 功能 | **Rationale:** A subset of _Folgen_. Defined by the author as *regular* consequences (manifest or latent) that make a *steady contribution* to the "functioning" of a society. |
| _absichtslos_ | unintended / intention-less | 無意的 / 非刻意的 | **Rationale:** This is the key modifier distinguishing latent functions. It means "without intent" or "intention-less." This is distinct from _unbeabsichtigt_ (unintentional/accidental). It implies a *structural* lack of intent, not just a random side-effect. The contribution is a by-product of science's mere existence, not its goal. |
| _verwissenschaftliche Gesellschaft_ | scientized society | 科學化的社會 | **Rationale:** Lit. "scientized" or "academized" society. Refers to a modern society that is not only influenced by science but *structurally dependent* on its organized application for its day-to-day survival. |
| _Herrschaft_ | rule / domination | 支配 | **Rationale:** A central Weberian concept. T1 uses "rule" as it aligns with the context of "institutions of rule" (_herrschaftliche Institutionen_). T2 uses the standard Chinese sociological translation 支配. |
| _verselbständigen sich_ | become autonomous / (to) autonomize | 自主化 | **Rationale:** From _selbständig_ (independent). The verb describes a process of *becoming* independent or autonomous *from* a larger context (in this case, group interests detaching from the societal whole). |
| _Tatsachenzusammenhänge_ | factual interrelationships / factual contexts | 事實脈絡 / 事實關聯 | **Rationale:** Lit. "fact-interconnections." This is the key domain of science. It’s not just "facts" (_Tatsachen_) but the *system* or *context* (_Zusammenhang_) connecting them. Science projects value-claims onto this *system* of facts. |
| _kommensurabel_ | commensurable | 可通約的 | **Rationale:** A direct translation of the mathematical/philosophical term. The core problem of pluralism is that conflicting group demands are *incommensurable* (lacking a common measure). |
| _Schiedsfunktion_ | umpire function / arbitration function | 仲裁功能 | **Rationale:** From _Schiedsrichter_ (umpire/arbitrator). Science's role is not to *judge* the "fairness" of claims (a value judgment) but to act as a neutral umpire that clarifies the *factual* basis and consequences, thereby forcing claims onto a common ground. |
| _Sachautorität_ | factual authority | 事實權威 | **Rationale:** *Sache* (matter, fact, thing) + *Autorität*. This is the *basis* of science's _Schiedsfunktion_. It is an authority derived *specifically* from its recognized competence with facts, not from moral, political, or religious standing. |
| _Sachlichkeit_ | factuality / objectivity / impartiality | 事實性 / 客觀性 | **Rationale:** The *ethos* required for _Sachautorität_. It is the quality of "sticking to the facts" (_Sache_). It is closely related to _Objektivität_ (objectivity) but emphasizes the *practice* of separating fact from value. |
| _Geisteswissenschaften_ | humanities | 精神科學 | **Rationale:** Lit. "sciences of the spirit/mind" (_Geist_). While "humanities" (人文科學) is common, 精神科學 is the more etymologically faithful translation and fits the author's context of "coping processes" (_Bewältigungsprozeß_) and "meaning-making" (_Sinndeutung_). |
