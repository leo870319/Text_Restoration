| Auslese | A core concept drawn from evolutionary biology but applied socially. It refers to the process by which the industrial apparatus "selects" specific human types that fit its requirements, rejecting the unfit. Weber distinguishes this from biological natural selection, focusing on social and economic mechanisms. | Selection | 篩選 |
| Anpassung | The reciprocal process where the workforce modifies its physical and psychophysical habits to meet the demands of the industrial machinery and discipline. | Adaptation | 適應 |
| Berufsschicksal | Not merely a "career," but the trajectory of life as determined by the external, coercive forces of the economic order. _Schicksal_ implies an inescapable power inherent in the modern system. | Occupational Destiny / Fate | 職業命運 |
| Menschentum | Weber uses this not to mean "humanity" generically, but the specific _qualitative type_ of human being produced by a specific historical and social environment. It implies the "content" of being human. | Humankind | 人性樣態 |
| Lebensführung | A central Weberian concept referring to the methodical, conscious management of one's daily existence. In this text, it is examined under the pressure of industrial discipline. | Conduct of Life | 生活經營 |

| Geschlossene Großindustrie | The specific object of the survey: highly capitalized, mechanized, and bureaucratically organized industrial units that form a "closed" system distinct from handicraft or small business. | Closed Large-Scale Industry | 封閉式大工業 |
| Arbeitseignung | The specific fit between a worker's psychophysical qualities and the technical demands of a machine or task. | Work Suitability / Aptitude | 工作適性 |
| Gelerntheit | A noun formed from the participle _gelernt_. Weber uses it to quantify the degree and type of training (apprenticeship vs. quick instruction) required for a job. | Skilled-ness / Learned-ness | 學成度 |
| Eingestelltheit | A psychophysical term referring to the state of readiness or preparation for a specific task or stimulus. Weber uses it to explain resistance to change or adaptation to monotony. | Set / Attitude / Adjustment | 定勢 / 心理預備 |
| Anlage | The innate, biological potential of an individual, often contrasted with _Milieu_ (environment) and _Übung_ (practice). | The innate, biological potential of an individual, often contrasted with _Milieu_ (environment) and _Übung_ (practice). | Disposition / Heritage | 稟賦 / 素質 |
| Apparat | Weber uses this to describe the totality of the industrial organization—technical, bureaucratic, and economic—as a machine-like structure that functions independently of the individuals within it. | Apparatus | 機械 |
| Gehäuse | Used in the conclusion to describe the overwhelming, inescapable structure of modern industrial capitalism. Precursor to the famous "steel-hard casing" (_stahlhartes Gehäuse_) metaphor. | casing | 殼 |
| Wertbeziehung | A methodological concept (Rickert/Weber) indicating that an object of study is selected because it relates to cultural values. Weber notes "intellectual" work usually has this, while monotonous factory work lacks it. | Value-relevance | 價值關聯 |
subjective satisfaction derived from labor. Weber treats it as a variable to be investigated. |
| Geistesgegenwart | Presence of Mind | A specific quality required for multi-loom weaving—not "intellectual" thought, but a state of continuous, dispersed alertness. | 應機 |
